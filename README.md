# hyperfuzz
A space and time optimized version of SmartFuzz

Masters Thesis project for Masters in Cyber Security from NYU Polytechnic School of engineering.
SmartFuzz written by Dave Molnar http://github.com/dmolnar/SmartFuz.git
is a symbolic executer based on valgrind and work done
for a masters project at UC Berkley by Dave Molnar and Dave Williams 2007.

The goal of this project is to bring SmartFuzz up to a current version of valgrind, and then to optimize the catchconv portion of 
SmartFuzz to improve runtime performance and disk/memory usage.
