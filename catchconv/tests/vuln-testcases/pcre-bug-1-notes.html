<h3>pcre integer / buffer overflows</h3>
<hr/>
<br/>Programs affected: pcre
<br/>Fixed version: v7.3
<br/>Advisory release date: Nov 7th 2007
<br/>Severity: compromise of processes using pcre to parse untrusted regex
patterns.
<p/>
Note - the problems noted here were actualy fixed a while ago in v6.7. However,
my colleague Tavis Ormandy has found multiple serious issues in more recent
versions. You really should use at least v7.3 if you need a secure pcre.
<p/>
More interesting usages of pcre to parse untrusted regular expressions include:
<b>Apple Safari</b>, including the <b>iPhone</b>. PHP. Others I can't yet
mention :)
<p/>
1) Integer overflow leading to buffer overflow.
<pre>
pcre_compile:
---
/* Compute the size of data block needed and get it, either from malloc or
externally provided function. */

size = length + sizeof(real_pcre) + name_count * (max_name_size + 3);
re = (real_pcre *)(pcre_malloc)(size);
---
</pre>

Unfortunately, a malicious regex can easily cause large "name_count" and "max_name_size" such that this calculation overflows.
Demo:
<pre>
(?P&lt;AAA...have 10^6 As in total...AAA&gt;)(?P&lt;0&gt;)(?P&lt;1&gt;)...fill in this sequence...(?P&lt;4293&gt;)
</pre>
Causes crash.
<p/>

2) Uncharacterized crash researching item #1 above:
Demo:
<pre>
(?P&lt;AAA...have 100 As in total...&gt;)(?P&lt;0&gt;)(?P&lt;1&gt;)...fill in this sequence...(?P&lt;3999&gt;)
</pre>
This does not trigger the integer overflow present in #1 above, but still crashes with a serious-looking memory error of some kind - possibly a buffer overflow.
<p/>

3) More possible integer overflow trouble.
<pre>
pcre_compile:
---
    if (min == 0)
      {
      length++;
      if (max > 0) length += (max - 1) * (duplength + 3 + 2*LINK_SIZE);
      }
...
    else
      {
      length += (min - 1) * duplength;
      if (max > min)   /* Need this test as max=-1 means no limit */
        length += (max - min) * (duplength + 3 + 2*LINK_SIZE)
          - (2 + 2*LINK_SIZE);
      }
---
</pre>
In both these cases, I see no reason why a malicious regexp pattern couldn't cause an integer overflow by using large min / max / duplength values. This will really mess up the critical "length" value.
