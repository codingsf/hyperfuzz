Running A Demo
--------------

Here are instructions for running a quick demo of the Catchconv tool:

1. Configure and install valgrind-catchconv
   From the valgrind-catchconv directory:
	./configure --prefix=PREFIX
	make
	make install

This has been tested with PREFIX=`pwd`/inst . 

2. Set the VALGRIND environment variable to $PREFIX/bin/valgrind

3. Download STP. You want the binary that understands the STP presentation
   language, NOT the SMT-LIB format.  Set the STP environment variable to 
   the path of your STP binary. 
   For example:
	wget http://theory.stanford.edu/~vganesh/stp.tar.gz
	tar xjf stp.tar.gz
	export STP=`pwd`/stp

4. Enter the catchconv/tests directory and run the "demo" script.
	cd catchconv/tests
	./demo

5. The demo will now begin. The script compiles a tiny test program,
   runs Catchconv on the test program, and then uses STP to synthesize
   some new test cases. Then it runs the test program on the new test cases.
   If all goes well, the test program reveals an error! 

   Note: this takes between 100 and 120 minutes on a fast machine with
   4 G of RAM. If you have less than 4 G of RAM, it may error out with
   an out of memory error. My apologies if this is the case; I'm working
   on getting the memory usage down.

6. You can then look at the Valgrind IR and corresponding constraints
   in verbose-latest-out. You can also look at the demo program in
   demoprog.c . The catchconv/docs directory also includes a technical
   report with a high-level description of the tool.
